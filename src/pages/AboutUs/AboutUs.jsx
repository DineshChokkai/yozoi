        <h5>Yozoi is a venture aiming to change the way support services are delivered to children and senior citizens. In addition to the ethos of bespoke care with compassion and respect, we are developing deep technologies integrated in a mobile application platform to empower people in local communities to deliver on-demand domiciliary services. Yozoi aspires to a hybrid services model where technology and humans work in tandem to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, security, and quality of our services.</h5>
        <h5>We aim to address domiciliary service issues caused by demographic and social changes such as aging populations, geographically spread-out families, and family units where both parents are working. The increase in the proportion of age 60+ in world populations has caused enormous pressures on health, care, and support services. Senior citizens are suffering from social services stressed by lack of funding, high costs, low quality & labour shortages. Changes in family units from extended to small, geographically spread families exacerbates the problem. It also generates a huge need for daily child care and support services to enable both parents to work and/or to look after elderly relatives.</h5>
        <h5>Yozoi’s vision is to “EMPOWER PEOPLE TO FULFIL THE DOMICILIARY SERVICE NEEDS OF THEIR SOCIETIES”. We strive to attract service providers from local communities via our flexible earnings model, free training, live support, and highest pay in the industry. We aim to offer customers a bespoke, on-demand and high-quality service with the highest standards of security and reliability. Our ultimate mission is “TO BE THE BEST ON-DEMAND MOBILE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM FOR DOMICILIARY SERVICES” and to delight both the service providers and customers.</h5>
